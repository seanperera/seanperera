### The New Future of Work
Currently one of the employees in the world working from home (WFH) :house_with_garden: joining the fight against Covid-19 pandemic. Just like you i am discovering challenges of WFH were having too many meetings, messages on the Teams public channels, feeling overworked, and physical and mental health. At the same time there are many things i am grateful for especially for increase family time.

Microsoft has shared their learnings of managing remotely in the [work-from-home guide](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/Work-from-home-guide.pptx). This includes reinforcing inclusion, checking in often, and coaching your teammates to help discover their own best practices for remote work. 

### *be kind TO YOURSELF* :hugs:
